* scipy >= 1.0.0
* python-openbabel >= 2.3.2
* ChemAxon's Marvin >= 16.11.14
* rdkit >= 2017.09.1

* pandas >= 0.21.0
* lmfit >= 0.9.2
* sympy >= 1.1.1

For more information regarding the methods, please refer to [our paper](https://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(18)30524-1) in Biophysical Journal.


## Installation on Ubuntu

1. `sudo apt-get install openbabel python-rdkit librdkit1 rdkit-data`
2. `sudo pip install -U numpy scipy scikit-learn pandas`
3. ChemAxon [Marvin suite](http://www.chemaxon.com/download/marvin-suite/)
   * add `cxcalc` to PATH
   * obtain a free academic license from ChemAxon
4. Optional
   * `sudo pip install -U lmfit sympy`

## Installation on Windows

1. Install 32-bit python2.7
   * [Winpython](https://github.com/winpython/winpython)
   * add `python.exe` to environment variables
   * for packages not included in WinPython, do `pip install [packagename]`
2. Install openbabel (version 2.3.2) and python bindings (version 1.8)
   * [openbabel](http://openbabel.org/wiki/Category:Installation)
   * [python bindings](http://open-babel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/UseTheLibrary/PythonInstall.html#windows)
3. ChemAxon [Marvin suite](http://www.chemaxon.com/download/marvin-suite/)
   * cxcalc module is typically added to PATH by the installer, if not, depending on where the specific package (e.g. MarvinBeans) of ChemAxon is installed, add `ChemAxon\MarvinBeans\bin` to environment variables
   * obtain a free academic license from ChemAxon
4. Optional
   * installation of [GNU Octave](https://blink1073.github.io/oct2py/source/installation.html)
   * for packages not included in WinPython, do `pip install [packagename]`
